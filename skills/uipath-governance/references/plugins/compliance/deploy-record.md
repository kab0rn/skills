# Deploy Record

Single audit JSON written per apply run. Captures both phases.

## Write rules

1. Write unconditionally — on total failure the file still exists with `created: []` + a `fatalError` field.
2. Default path: `./deploy-record-{packId}-{applyTs}.json`. Respect `--deploy-record-path` override.
3. Write **once** at the end of the run, not incrementally.
4. Do NOT commit / stage to git. Contains tenant identifiers.

## Status semantics

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `success` | CLI call returned 2xx and the expected identifier was captured. |
| `failed` | CLI call returned 4xx/5xx. `error` populated. Phase halted at this policy. |
| `skipped` | Policy was never attempted. Always paired with a `reason` field: |

### Skip reasons

| `reason` | When |
|---|---|
| `access-policies-not-yet-supported` | `policyKind: "access"` entry in the pack. Access-policy CLI lives on `jianjunwang/governance-policy-tool` and hasn't merged. |
| `out-of-clause-scope`  | Policy file's contributing clauses are all excluded by scope selection. |
| `prior-failure`        | A preceding policy in the same phase hit a 4xx (fail-fast). |
| `mode-skip`            | Mode is `create-only` (Phase 2 skipped) or `deploy-only` (Phase 1 skipped). |
| `user-halted`          | User did not confirm at the pre-flight gate. |

## Re-apply sanity

Because policy names are deterministic per `(packId, scenario, identifier)`, a naive re-run will 409 on the first create. The deploy record is how the operator reconciles: compare `created[].status == "success"` from a prior record against AOPS state before re-running, clean up conflicts manually (V1 has no rollback), then re-run.
