# UiPath Coded Agents — Quickstart

## CLI Setup (run once at start)

Before running any `uip codedagent` commands, ensure the environment is ready:

```bash
# 1. Check uip is installed
which uip > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "uip found" || echo "uip NOT found — run: npm install -g @uipath/cli"

# 2. Activate the virtual environment (required if .venv exists)
if [ -d ".venv" ]; then source .venv/bin/activate; fi

# 3. Set up the Python environment (detects Python, installs uipath package if needed)
uip codedagent setup --output json
```

**Steps 2 and 3 are required.** Common errors if skipped:
- `"uipath executable not found"` → run `uip codedagent setup` first
- `"Found .venv but no virtual environment is activated"` → run `source .venv/bin/activate` before setup

Run these once per project environment. After setup succeeds, all `uip codedagent` commands will work.

If `uip` is not found, install it with `npm install -g @uipath/cli`. If `npm` is missing, ask the user to install Node.js first. All commands in this skill use `uip codedagent <cmd>` — do **not** substitute with `uv run uipath`.

**Do NOT add `--output json` to `uip codedagent` commands.** The `--output` flag is only valid for native `uip` commands (like `uip login`, `uip codedagent setup`). Commands forwarded to the Python CLI (`uip codedagent new`, `init`, `run`, `eval`, `deploy`, `push`, `pull`, `pack`, `publish`, `invoke`) do **not** accept `--output json` and will error.

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER add a `[build-system]` section to `pyproject.toml`**. No `hatchling`, no `setuptools`, no build backend. UiPath agents do not use a build system. Only include `[project]`, `[dependency-groups]`, and `[tool.*]` sections.
- **Always create a smoke evaluation set.** Every agent must include `evaluations/eval-sets/smoke-test.json` with 2-3 basic test cases. Create it in the Evaluate step, not during Build.
- **Select a framework before writing any code.** If the prompt clearly implies a framework (e.g., mentions tools, RAG, multi-step orchestration, or a specific SDK), pick the best match. If the prompt is ambiguous, ask the user to choose from: Simple Function, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or OpenAI Agents.
- **Correct SDK import: `from uipath.platform import UiPath`** — not `from uipath import UiPath` (that path does not exist and will cause `ImportError`). Always instantiate `UiPath()` inside functions/nodes, never at module level.
- **NEVER run `uip login` without `--tenant`.** The interactive tenant picker does not work from Claude's Bash tool. Always ask the user for environment, organization, and tenant name first, then run `uip login --output json` then `uip login tenant set "<TENANT>" --output json`.
- **Skip auth if already authenticated.** Before asking for credentials, check if `.env` contains `UIPATH_URL` and `UIPATH_ACCESS_TOKEN` (or run `uip login status --output json` if available). If auth is already configured, skip the Auth step entirely and continue the flow.
- **Auth MUST be an interactive question (when needed).** If auth is NOT configured, your ENTIRE response must be a single direct question. Do NOT wrap it in bullet points, "Next Steps" headers, or status summaries. Just ask and stop:

  > What is your UiPath **environment** (cloud/staging/alpha), **organization name**, and **tenant name**?
- **In a flow, coded agents are referenced via the [`agent`](../../../uipath-maestro-flow/references/plugins/agent/) plugin** — node type `uipath.core.agent.{key}`, `Orchestrator.StartAgentJob`. See [flow-integration.md](flow-integration.md) for the three patterns: in-solution sibling folder, Orchestrator-published, tool resource.

## Lifecycle Stages

Each stage has a reference file with detailed instructions. Read **only** the relevant reference when you reach that stage — do not preload.

| Stage | Reference | CLI Commands |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Auth** | [../authentication.md](../authentication.md) | `uip login` |
| **Setup** | [lifecycle/setup.md](lifecycle/setup.md) | `uip codedagent new <name>`, `uv sync`, `uip codedagent init` |
| **Build** | [lifecycle/build.md](lifecycle/build.md) | Code agent logic with framework patterns |
| **Bindings** | [lifecycle/bindings-reference.md](lifecycle/bindings-reference.md) | Sync resource overrides in `bindings.json` |
| **Run** | [lifecycle/running-agents.md](lifecycle/running-agents.md) | `uip codedagent run` |
| **Evaluate** | [lifecycle/evaluate.md](lifecycle/evaluate.md) | `uip codedagent eval` |
| **Deploy** | [lifecycle/deployment.md](lifecycle/deployment.md) | `uip codedagent deploy`, `uip codedagent invoke` |
| **Sync** | [lifecycle/file-sync.md](lifecycle/file-sync.md) | `uip codedagent push`, `uip codedagent pull` |
| **Flow Integration** | [flow-integration.md](flow-integration.md) | Inline, published node, or tool resource in Flow |

## Build Scenarios

Two top-level build paths. Pick one before starting — the lifecycle and publish mechanism differ.

- **Scenario 1 — Standalone Coded Agent** — the agent is its own tenant resource, published via `uip codedagent deploy`. Use when the agent runs on its own, is called from multiple flows, or needs independent versioning.
- **Scenario 2 — In-Solution Coded Agent in a Flow** — the agent lives as a **sibling folder** to a flow project and is published together with the flow via a single `uip solution upload`. The flow references it as an in-solution `uipath.core.agent.<resourceKey>` node, where `<resourceKey>` is the local UUID minted by `uip solution project add` and discoverable via `uip maestro flow registry list --local`. Use when the agent is tightly coupled to one flow.

## Quick Start: Scenario 1 — Standalone Coded Agent

When the user asks to create and deploy an agent end-to-end, follow these steps in order. Skip stages that are already done.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT stop between steps to ask "would you like me to continue?" or list next steps. Execute the entire flow automatically. Only pause when you genuinely need information from the user (auth credentials, project ID). After getting that info, resume immediately.**

1. **Framework** — Select framework from prompt context or ask user (see below). This MUST happen before setup because `uip codedagent new` scaffolds based on which framework package is installed.
2. **Setup** — Scaffold project: add framework dependency (`uv add uipath-langchain` etc.), `uv sync`, `uip codedagent new <project-name>`, then run `uip codedagent init`. Infer the project name from the user's prompt or the current directory name. **Do NOT authenticate yet** — auth happens after build.
3. **Build** — Implement agent logic using the selected framework's patterns. **CRITICAL: Always use lazy LLM initialization.** Never instantiate `UiPathAzureChatOpenAI`, `UiPathChat`, `UiPathChatOpenAI`, or any LLM client at module level — `uip codedagent init` imports the file and module-level LLM clients will fail because auth hasn't happened yet. Always create LLM instances inside functions/nodes. After implementing, re-run `uip codedagent init` to update schemas from the actual code.
4. **Bindings** — If the agent uses any UiPath platform resources (assets, queues, connections, processes, buckets, context grounding indexes, Action Center apps, or MCP servers), sync `bindings.json` with the code using [lifecycle/bindings-reference.md](lifecycle/bindings-reference.md). This ensures resource overrides work correctly when deployed to Orchestrator. Skip this step if the agent does not call any bindable SDK methods.
5. **Auth** — First check if `.env` already has `UIPATH_URL` and auth tokens. If yes, skip this step. If not, ask the user for credentials — output ONLY this question as your entire response:

> What is your UiPath **environment** (cloud/staging/alpha), **organization name**, and **tenant name**?

Then STOP and wait for the user to reply. After they reply, run `uip login --output json followed by uip login tenant set "<TENANT>" --output json` and continue the flow. Never run `uip login` without `--tenant`.
6. **Run** — Test locally with `uip codedagent run <ENTRYPOINT> '<input>'` (use the entrypoint name from `entry-points.json`, e.g., `main`).
7. **Push** — Tell the user to navigate to `{UIPATH_URL with the tenant segment removed}/studio_/projects` (Studio Web is an organization-level service, so the URL should only include the organization, e.g. `https://alpha.uipath.com/OrgName/studio_/projects`), create a new **Coded Agent** project, and paste the project ID. Add `UIPATH_PROJECT_ID=<id>` to `.env`, then run `uip codedagent push`. Required before evals. *(This step requires user input — wait for the project ID, then resume immediately.)*
8. **Evaluate** — Create **both** the evaluator config and the eval set, then run evals.

   **First**, create `evaluations/evaluators/llm-judge-trajectory.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0",
     "id": "LLMJudgeTrajectoryEvaluator",
     "evaluatorTypeId": "uipath-llm-judge-trajectory-similarity",
     "evaluatorConfig": {
       "name": "LLMJudgeTrajectoryEvaluator",
       "defaultEvaluationCriteria": {
         "expectedAgentBehavior": "Agent should process the input and return a response."
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Then**, create `evaluations/eval-sets/smoke-test.json` with 2-3 test cases based on the agent's input schema (version is string `"1.0"`, top-level `id`/`name` required, test cases in `evaluations` array):
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0",
     "id": "smoke-test",
     "name": "Smoke Test",
     "evaluatorRefs": ["LLMJudgeTrajectoryEvaluator"],
     "evaluations": [
       {
         "id": "test-1",
         "name": "Basic test",
         "inputs": {"field": "value"},
         "evaluationCriterias": {
           "LLMJudgeTrajectoryEvaluator": {
             "expectedAgentBehavior": "Agent should process the input and return a response."
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   **Finally**, run `uip codedagent eval <ENTRYPOINT> evaluations/eval-sets/smoke-test.json` (use the entrypoint name from `entry-points.json`).
9. **Deploy** — Run `uip codedagent deploy --my-workspace`. Do NOT ask the user which feed to use — default to `--my-workspace` and inform them: "Deploying to your personal workspace." If re-deploying, bump the patch version in `pyproject.toml` first.

Read the relevant reference file at each step — do not guess.

## Quick Start: Scenario 2 — In-Solution Coded Agent in a Flow

Use when the coded agent is tightly coupled to one flow and should be published together with it via `uip solution upload` — no separate Orchestrator deployment.

See [embedding-in-flows.md](embedding-in-flows.md) for the full pipeline: scaffold as a sibling folder, register in the solution with `uip solution project add`, wire the flow node using `--local` registry discovery against the minted `resource.key`, then `uip solution upload` once.

Flow node JSON shape is in [flow-integration.md — Pattern 1](flow-integration.md#pattern-1-in-solution-coded-agent).

## Framework Selection

Infer the framework from the user's prompt when possible. If ambiguous, ask them to choose:

1. **Simple Function** — Plain Python with `Input`/`Output` models. No LLM. Best for deterministic logic.
2. **LangGraph** — StateGraph with conditional routing, tool use, interrupts. Best for complex LLM agents.
3. **LlamaIndex** — Workflow with events and RAG support. Best for knowledge retrieval.
4. **OpenAI Agents** — Lightweight agent with tools and handoffs. Best for simple LLM agents.

**Inference hints:** mentions of tools/tool calling, multi-step, or orchestration → LangGraph. RAG or knowledge retrieval → LlamaIndex. Simple handoffs or lightweight LLM → OpenAI Agents. No LLM needed → Simple Function. When in doubt, ask.

**Always tell the user which framework you selected and why** before proceeding to build. Example: "I'll use **LangGraph** for this agent since it involves tool calling and multi-step orchestration."

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Project authors cannot be empty` | Missing `authors` in `pyproject.toml` | Add `authors = [{ name = "Your Name" }]` to `[project]` section |
| `Version already exists` on deploy | Same version already published | Bump patch version in `pyproject.toml` before re-deploying |
| `Your local version is behind...Aborted!` | Push needs interactive confirmation | Use `uip codedagent push --overwrite` to force push |
